					Hello again.<br /><br />
					Have you been out to support your local music scene lately? Now that summer is upon us there seems 
					to suddenly be a rather sizable increase in the number of concerts that will truly be awesome. 
					I myself spent my memorial day weekend exclusively at rock clubs. Friday night I was at the 
					<a href='http://www.triplerocksocialclub.com/'>triple rock,</a> and saturday and sunday nights 
					were spent at the <a href='http://www.turfclub.net/'>turf club.</a> For the record, the turf
					is now non-smoking, and is one of the truly great places to see a band play. Nancy actually spent 
					her entire weekend at the turf club, she's a real trooper. 
					<span >the Stnnng</span> were playing at the Triple 
					Rock friday night, and as I had never seen them, but had heard they were great, i took my friend 
					Peter up on his offer to be his guest list +1. While it is not really the style of music that I dig, 
					<span >the Stnnng</span> (read as &quot;stunning&quot;) are quite an energetic punk/rock 
					band that really do put 
					on a great show. And to be honest, that is the sort of reviews that I have read of them in the local 
					papers and music websites, the live shows are exciting and intense, and the band appears to really 
					love to play.<br />
					<br />
					Saturday's show at the turf was a birthday party extravaganza for a local music website, 
					<a href='http://www.howastheshow.com'>how was the show.com.</a> They celebrated 4 years of 
					reporting on local shows. congrats, that is a lot of work, i can barely handle the occasionally 
					monthly postings I do, and these people see nearly every show worth seeing in the twin cities. 
					wow. the line up for their show was one of the more amazing that i have been privy to see. I missed 
					the first to acts, but the last three were amazing: <span >the Alarmists</span>, 
					<span >White Light Riot</span> and <span >Alva Star</span>. 
					<span >Alva Star's</span> set was a little rough. they don't play that often, 
					so perhaps they were just out of 
					practice, or maybe John Hermanson had just drank to much crappy wine at the Turf Club, either way, 
					it started out rough, vocals were off guitar chords were wrong, but it slowly improved as their set 
					moved on. An unfortunate showing for a once great local act. Hopefully as they increase show 
					frequency they will step up the performance as well. <br />
					<br />

					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://www.soundmachinedream.com/a/alarm.jpg' alt='the alarmists - detail of soldiers album cover' />
					<span >White light Riot</span> and <span >the Alarmists</span> were 
					both prepared for their sets thankfully. <span >White Light Riot</span> 
					were an exciting four piece with one foot in the dance-rock pool, the other in clever rock, and 
					one ugly lead singer with ill-fitting clothes. Were they great? of course. 
					<span >The Alarmists</span> play 
					something that started as brit-pop, decided that Coldplay have now lost their taste, grew up 
					and moved onâ€”all while frantically playing tambourine. The two sets inspired me to buy both 
					bands albums. No one from <span >white light riot</span> could be found, 
					presumably due to post-set riotous 
					rock behavior, so I ended up with just <span >the alarmists'</span> disc, 
					<em>A Detail of Soldiers</em>. <br />
					<br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://www.soundmachinedream.com/a/pattern.gif' alt='chris koza - patterns album cover' />
					Chris Koza's newest effort, entitled <em>Patterns</em> 
					was released not to long ago. I picked up my copy 
					a week or two ago when I went to see him play at the <a href='http://www.331club.com'>331 Club</a> 
					on a wednesday night (i especially like to 
					go to the 331 on Raleigh's texas taco tuesdays to eat the wondrous tacos... just fyi). The record is a really 
					nice piece of work. It was recorded with the help of one Paul Marino (who some of the readers may 
					remember from NHS) at Pachyderm Studios in cannon falls, and at Paul's home studio. The recording is 
					really excellent. It is nice to find a piece of work from a band so early in their 
					career that is really nicely polished. The arrangements are all very well thought out, very 
					intelligent, and really compliment the songs. My favorite tracks off of the record are <em>Midnight 
					Rose, View From a Pier, Patterns,</em> and <em>Divine Andromedary.</em> These four songs really capture the 
					aesthetic that I get from the band, the experimental indie-folk-pop sound I picture 
					when I hear the band play live. Of course, this is just my 
					personal and subjective opinion. The only song on here that I don't think fits into the record is 
					track 7, <em>Fear of Mimes.</em> The style of music and lyrics suddenly change on this one track, evoking 
					a sort of 60's bubble-gum sort of feel reminiscent of some early Beatles head bobbers. Compared 
					to the rest of the album this one song just seems trite and quickly contrived. 
					Despite the one track&mdash;which i don't actually not enjoy, i just don't think it fits&mdash;I really 
					am liking this album. I look forward to hearing what 
					new things lay on the road ahead for Chris and his band-mates. (side note, some may think this 
					review to be biased, as Nancy is friends with Chris, but he really is pretty good, and it seems the 
					rest of minneapolis and st. paul think so too.)<br />
					<br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://www.soundmachinedream.com/a/brokenboy.jpg' alt='the raconteurs - broken boy soldier album cover' />
					One of the most hyped new releases in past months has been the debut album by the Raconteurs 
					I think i heard a plug for it just about everyday on the local indie radio station, not to mention random
					podcasts I listen to and such. Thus I was sceptical as to the actual quality of <em>Broken Boy Soldier</em>.
					Having actually enjoyed Brendan Benson's music for sometime, as well as The White Stripes', I felt that there was 
					at least some small promise of quality accompanying the hype. Fortunately, all was not lost, and the album is good.
					It is a little strange however. Both Jack White and Benson share song writing credit on all songs, Lennon/McCartney style, 
					however it seems apparent to me that the songs that each sings are those that they've written. 
					The songs voiced by Brendan Benson sound like Brendan Benson songs.
					The Jack White voiced songs sound like 'the Raconteurs,' more than just Jack White with some different 
					guys backing him (who by the way are the Greenhorns, they worked with him on Van Lear Rose too), 
					they sound like real band songs. Perhaps it is the way in which each musician normally works that 
					so differently affects the way that they come off on the record. Jack white is in a rather major and 
					popular touring act that some of you might have heard of&mdash; the white stripes. Brendan Benson,
					has not been in many bands of national acclaim, he mostly is a 'solo' artist. Brendan's music
					has come from many sources, many backing bands, many extra musicians, 
					his albums always much more a sort of a collaborative effort. 
					Brendan's past has involved him playing 
					many more roles in many more projects (to my knowledge) than Jack's past does. Thus, when the two bring
					themselves into a project such as this, it seems natural to me to see that Jack might view this as a seperate
					entity to his music making, a totally different band experience, while Brendan may see it as a new way
					to play the same sort of music he always does, his music with whoever happens to be around at the time.
					Or maybe its just the Voices, Jack's seems to change as the song requires, and Brendan always ends up sounding 
					like Brendan. Either way, I liked the record, there are some real great tunes on it, a lot of 60's style rock
					songs, real "beatlesque" harmonies and arrangements, goodsolid instrumentation, and i really like the guitar tones. 
					<br /><br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://www.soundmachinedream.com/a/theloon.jpg' alt='tapes n tapes - the loon album cover' />
					And finally, I am not gonna say much about it as I have rambled on here enough, but the new 
					Tapes 'N' Tapes, called <em>The Loon</em>, is awesome. It puts their original record to shame, which was intentionally lo-fi and
					sort of wierdly bad, and just did not show the sort of song writing that the new album achieves. It sounds 
					nicer too. They were a smash as SXSW and I believe they have even been written up in the 
					New Yorker... or was it the New York Times... either way, <em>wow!</em>
					<br /><br />
					Looking forward to sunshine
					<br /><br />
					Kristian
					<br /><br />
					<em>p.s.<br />
					I found out (at the sunday turf show that i did not describe) that two of my favorite local musicians 
					are in a new band. Todd Hansen and Dave Campbell have both joined the forces of The Winter Blanket. Hurray! 
					Based on line up alone this is probably my new favorite band. Cannot wait to see them play some live shows, 
					everyone keep a look out.</em>
