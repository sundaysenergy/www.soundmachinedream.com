					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://homepage.mac.com/soundmachinedream/musicblog/a/claphands.jpg' alt='clap your hands say yeah! album cover' />
					So, the <em class='caps'>clap your hands and say yeah</em> show in Minneapolis was sold out in about a day.
					Some of Nancy's friends were complaining that the tickets went so fast.  I told them that is what happens
					when a band is hyped so badly&mdash;and then play an insanely small venue. I guess they will just have to 
					wait 'til next year when either (a) they play at First-Avenue to a much larger crowd or (b) nobody cares 
					about them anymore, making tickets much easier to get. I am going with option (b).<br />
					<br />
					January was a slow month for getting records. With Christmas being so recently over, and so many family 
					and friends having birthdays, I lacked the proper funds to purcahse myself records. I had to make due
					with old standby's that I had not listened too in a while, as well as more recent purchases that never
					really sunk in <em>(like the Shout out Louds, L'altra, and an older Westerberg album)</em>.
					<br /><br />
					I have to tell you that iTunes and my iPod do occasionally get in the way of complete album listening, 
					Perhaps I will have to put a "singles i have listened to" section up as well. It is nice to just hit 
					play and be surprised. For instance, I downloaded the SXSW mp3's from the 2005 South by Southwest event 
					and to this day still hear new songs from my computer speakers while on shuffle. That was nearly a year 
					ago, and I have yet to hear all the 2000 songs. Crazy. I do highly recommend downloading the SXSW tracks,
					in fact when the festival kicks off again this year I will put a link here so you all can find them. There
					is some really great stuff in the 2gigs of songs&mdash;there is a lot of crap too&mdash;but the good 
					far outweighs the bad. I believe there is one track from nearly every band that plays the event. Amazing.
					<br /><br />
					On to the albums...
					<br /><br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://homepage.mac.com/soundmachinedream/musicblog/a/heartbreaker.jpg' alt='ryan adams - heartbreaker album cover' />
					First on the list, <em class='caps'>Heartbreaker</em> by <span class='caps'>Ryan Adams</span>. A friend
					of mine just bought <em>'29'</em> and wanted to hear some of the other stuff. I recommended he start at
					the beginning of Adam's solo stuff, and lent him <em class='caps'>Heartbreaker</em>. Upon the album being 
					returned to me, I began to listen to it again as well. Also, I saw Ryan Adams play on Letterman several
					weeks ago, and he played <em>Come Pick Me Up</em> off of <em class='caps'>Heartbreaker</em> instead of one 
					of his newer songs. His initial offering is still a very enjoyable record. Adam's style has made a sort of 
					zig-zag path from this initial recording to what he is doing now.
					<br /><br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://homepage.mac.com/soundmachinedream/musicblog/a/tambourine.jpg' alt='tift merrit - tambourine album cover' />
				  	An attempt to watch Ryan Adams perform on Austin City Limits led me (and nancy) to another artist, 
					<span class='caps'>Tift Merrit</span>. Nancy the next available day went out and purchased her last record 
					<em class='caps'>Tambourine.</em> Tift is on Lost Highway Records along with Adams, and shares the same 
					country-blues / country-rock stylings. She is fairly comparable to a younger bonnie raitt, or perhaps a 
					more country influenced norah jones. Fans of Gillian Welch and Kathleen Edwards would be wise to pick up 
					her release. I don't hear a particularly large amount of tambourine, so perhaps I am missing where the 
					title is coming from.  However, George Drakoulias (the other part of the American Records team-i.e. not 
					Rick Rubin) produced the record, and it has the same sort of rock flair that made bands like the 
					Jayhawks and Tom Petty's early recordings so well liked.
					<br /><br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://homepage.mac.com/soundmachinedream/musicblog/a/shout.jpg' alt='the shout out louds - howl howl gaff gaff album cover' />
					<span class='caps'>The Shout out louds</span> are another beauty of a group hailing from sweden. 
					Damn i love those nordics. <span class='caps'>kings of convenience</span>, check, 
					<span class='caps'>the concretes</span>, check, <span class='caps'>the ravonettes</span>, check... 
					the list could go on. Checklists aside, <span class='caps'>the shout out louds</span> write simple, 
					compelling, indie pop tracks that hook you in. Most notably agreeable is the first track, The Comeback. 
					The simple one verse, one chorus and repeat format makes for a neat little number that has a good 
					beat and steady, even strum guitars. It is IKEA simplicity applied in 3 minutes to music. When 
					initially released, this track was a staple of 
					<a href='http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/'>The Current's</a> 
					day to day track lists. Another fave of mine from the disc was track 4, A TRACK AND A TRAIN which bizarrely 
					sounds just like a new VICIOUS VICIOUS song called Castaways. Unfortunately for the artwork this CD does 
					brandish the FBI anti-piracy logo, but the designer did handle it the best of all the discs I have seen 
					thus far.
				   	<br /><br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://homepage.mac.com/soundmachinedream/musicblog/a/blocked.jpg' alt='crystal skulls - blocked numbers album cover' />
					Next on the the list, CRYSTAL SKULLS. Last time I told you all to go and check out their record, and so 
					I took the advice myself and started listening to them again. I really got hooked back in and I am 
					really excited to hear their new record which should be released farely soon I should guess. They have 
					a good style that I have not really heard repeated by any other groups. I saw them on tour with Suicide 
					Squeeze labelmates HEADPHONES. I really went to see my pals DUPLOMACY open up, but it was worth my while 
					to stay for the rest. Headphones I had already heard at the time, but the Crystal Skulls sort of blew me 
					away. I was unprepared for what came off the stage&mdash;given the sort of droopy appearance of most of the band. 
					There's is a good combination of smart lyrics, good arrangements, interesting song structures. In short, 
					a winning combination that I give an enthusiastic thumbs up. 
					<br /><br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://homepage.mac.com/soundmachinedream/musicblog/a/differentdays.jpg' alt='laltra - different days album cover' />
					DIFFERENT DAYS by L'ALTRA was a recent purchase. The disc was released in early 2005 and I heard two 
					or three songs off the album on the current before i decided to go out and buy it. The band is made up 
					a former husband and wife duo, whose apparently messy divorce did not stop them from being able to work 
					in the studio together. According to my sources they said to each other that the band was their job and 
					they could work together to still make music. Pretty cool. The record definitely carries a somber, 
					depressed feel to it, perhaps a relic of the divorce, perhaps just their style. I do not know, but I 
					did like the record. I have been told that I like to listen to depressing music, and so that may be a 
					reason that I've been enjoying this. The somberness level is up their with the likes of ARAB STRAP, 
					LOW, or maybe RED HOUSE PAINTERS less rocking moments. The disc is slow in tempo, and even in its 
					mood, occasional electric drums punching through slowly strummed guitars, soft strings and carefully 
					tapped piano keys.
					<br /><br />
					<img class='albumimg' width='72px' height='72px' src='http://homepage.mac.com/soundmachinedream/musicblog/a/unicorn.jpg' alt='unicorns - who will cut our hair when were gone album cover' />
					Um, could somebody tell me why I have not heard this Unicorns record (who will cut our hair...) before? 
					It is awesome! The right amount of Lo-Fi combined with smart arranging and orchestration. A lot of great 
					elements coming together, exuberance, up-tempo / down tempo change ups, electronic drum beats leading 
					into real drums, crazy synths, crappy guitar parts, sloppy solos, the breathy, youthful vocals.  I love 
					it. Everyone should go out and buy this right now.  I tried to check out their website, but apparently 
					they are a band no more. Let their lyrics speak to the wonder and memory of the band, "...we are unicorns, 
					we're more than horses..." Wow.
